## [!] Safety

In Newer York, your safety is our top priority. Our police force is effective and responds quickly to settle any local conflict and crime. Patrol officers are always around to check every corner of the streets for trouble. Traffic accidents happen rarely, as most people in Newer York tend to use our incredibly effective public transportation and our biking infrastructure is outstanding.

We have good foreign relations, so there is little to no war and international conflict. 

As Newer York relies heavily on nuclear power, we make sure we have safety measures and precautions to reduce the risk of a meltdown, and we make sure that the reactor itself is far away from citizens.
